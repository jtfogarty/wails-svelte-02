# A wails.io project that pull cat facts and displays them.

Created by `wails init -n wails-svelte-01 -t svelte` and then renaming. 
I also used https://github.com/NerdCademyDev/golang/blob/main/12_json_to_struct/main.go for insparation.  
 
## About

This is the official Wails Svelte template.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
